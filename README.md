<h1 align="center">✨ About Me ✨</h1>

I'm a passionate and curious tech enthusiast with a deep interest in software development, especially in the Web and AI space. I thrive at the intersection of creativity and logic, where I love turning ideas into impactful applications. Over the years, I've explored diverse areas including iOS development, computer vision, and full-stack web projects, constantly pushing myself to learn and grow.

Whether it's leading tech communities like GDSC as Lead, solving algorithmic problems (even when they're frustrating!), or building tools that make life easier for others, I believe in consistent effort, honesty, and learning through doing. Currently, I'm on a journey to sharpen my DSA skills and document the process transparently through my YouTube series Zero to Hero.

Outside of code, I enjoy simplifying complex topics, guiding peers, and creating content that educates and inspires. I'm always open to collaboration, feedback, and new challenges!
